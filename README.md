# Propane

Propane is a simple Project/Task manager  responsive web app made with Bootstrap. It allows you to add several projects and add tasks to them.

It follows the KANBAN methodology so your tasks fall intro three categories: TO DO, DOING and DONE, pretty self explanatory, in the beginning all of them are in TO DO list, by the end all of them should be in the DONE list. With Propane you can create as many projects as you want and move the task around freely inside each project.


It is a simple web-app done in HTML/CSS/Javascript. Everything is done as vanilla as possible, since it is more of an educational project to see if I can front-end.

Data persistence is achieved via local storage which is not the best option, by far. It simply was used so I could focus only on front-end.
Feel free to fork and polish it as well as add new features.

Current features:
- Add and remove multiple projects
- Move tasks freely between each 3 states: TO DO, DOING, DONE.
- Change the order of tasks inside each list.
- Data saved on localstorage (be carefull when erasing cookies :) )

Future features:
- Pomodoro timer for each task.
- Project report with time spent in each task (based on pomodoro)
